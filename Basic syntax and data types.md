## 1. Introduction to Programming Syntax

**Syntax** refers to the set of rules that define the combinations of symbols considered correctly structured in a programming language. Understanding syntax is crucial because even a small error can cause a program to fail.

**Example of Correct Syntax (Python):**

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Example of Incorrect Syntax:**

```python
print("Hello, World!)
# Missing closing quotation mark and parenthesis
```

<a name="2-variables"></a>
## 2. Variables and Naming Conventions

Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

### Declaring Variables

In Python, you declare a variable by assigning a value to it:

```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)**
- **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores**
- **Case-sensitive**

**Valid Variable Names:**

- `my_var`
- `age`
- `_private_var`
- `userName`

**Invalid Variable Names:**

- `2ndVar`  (Starts with a number)
- `my-var`  (Contains a hyphen)
- `class`   (Reserved keyword)

<a name="3-data-types"></a>
## 3. Basic Data Types

Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold.

<a name="3-1-numbers"></a>
### 3.1 Numbers

#### Integers (`int`)

Whole numbers, positive or negative.

```python
a = 10
b = -5
```

#### Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)

Numbers with a decimal point.

```python
pi = 3.14159
temperature = -15.5
```

#### Complex Numbers (`complex`)

Numbers with a real and imaginary part.

```python
z = 2 + 3j
```

**Type Checking:**

```python
type(a)  # Output: <class 'int'>
type(pi) # Output: <class 'float'>
```

<a name="3-2-strings"></a>
### 3.2 Strings

Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
message = 'Python is fun!'
```

**Multi-line Strings:**

```python
multiline = """This is a
multi-line string."""
```

**String Operations:**

```python
# Concatenation
full_name = "John" + " " + "Doe"  # Output: "John Doe"

# Repetition
laugh = "ha" * 3  # Output: "hahaha"
```

<a name="3-3-booleans"></a>
### 3.3 Booleans

Represent truth values: `True` or `False`.

```python
is_valid = True
has_passed = False
```

<a name="3-4-none"></a>
### 3.4 NoneType (Null)

Represents the absence of a value.

```python
result = None
```

---

<a name="4-composite-data-types"></a>
## 4. Composite Data Types

Composite data types can hold multiple items.

<a name="4-1-lists"></a>
### 4.1 Lists (Arrays)

Ordered, mutable collections of items.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, True]
```

**Accessing Elements:**

```python
first_fruit = fruits[0]     # "apple"
last_fruit = fruits[-1]     # "cherry"
```

**Modifying Lists:**

```python
fruits.append("date")
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
```

<a name="4-2-tuples"></a>
### 4.2 Tuples

Ordered, immutable collections of items.

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
```

**Accessing Elements:**

```python
x = coordinates[0]  # 10.0
```

<a name="4-3-dictionaries"></a>
### 4.3 Dictionaries (Maps)

Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "courses": ["Math", "Physics"]
}
```

**Accessing Values:**

```python
student_name = student["name"]  # "Alice"
```

**Adding/Modifying Entries:**

```python
student["age"] = 26
student["grade"] = "A"
```

<a name="4-4-sets"></a>
### 4.4 Sets

Unordered collections of unique items.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
# unique_numbers will be {1, 2, 3}
```

<a name="6-control-flow"></a>
## 6. Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements are used to control the order of execution of the program.

<a name="6-1-if"></a>
### 6.1 `if`, `elif`, `else` Statements

```python
age = 18

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Adult")
# Output: Teenager
```

<a name="6-2-for-loops"></a>
### 6.2 `for` Loops

Used to iterate over a sequence.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```

**Using `range()`:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

<a name="6-3-while-loops"></a>
### 6.3 `while` Loops

Repeats as long as a condition is true.

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

<a name="6-4-break-continue"></a>
### 6.4 `break` and `continue`

- **`break`**: Exit the loop.
- **`continue`**: Skip to the next iteration.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4

for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output: 1 3 5 7 9
```

---

<a name="7-functions"></a>
## 7. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

<a name="7-1-defining-functions"></a>
### 7.1 Defining Functions

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```

**Calling a Function:**

```python
greet()  # Output: Hello!
```

<a name="7-2-function-arguments"></a>
### 7.2 Function Arguments

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Default Arguments:**

```python
def greet(name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet()          # Output: Hello, World!
greet("Bob")     # Output: Hello, Bob!
```

<a name="7-3-return-statements"></a>
### 7.3 Return Statements

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)  # result is 8
```

---

<a name="8-comments"></a>
## 8. Comments and Docstrings

Comments are notes in the code that are ignored by the interpreter.

### Single-Line Comments

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-Line Comments (Docstrings)

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring.
"""
```

**Inline Comments:**

```python
x = 5  # Assign 5 to x
```

---

<a name="9-indentation"></a>
## 9. Indentation and Code Blocks

Indentation is crucial in Python to define code blocks.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("Still inside the block")
print("Outside the block")
```

- **Standard Indentation:** 4 spaces.
- **Do not mix tabs and spaces.**

---

<a name="10-best-practices"></a>
## 10. Best Practices

- **Meaningful Variable Names:** Use descriptive names.
  
  ```python
  total_price = price * quantity
  ```

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**

  - **snake_case** for variables and functions.
  - **CamelCase** for class names.

- **Comment Your Code:** Explain complex logic.

- **DRY Principle:** Don't Repeat Yourself. Use functions to avoid code duplication.

- **Avoid Global Variables:** Use local variables and pass them as arguments.
